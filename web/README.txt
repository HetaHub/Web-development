This website is using Bootstrap 4 to make, therefore inserted css and script library from bootstrap. All CSS are in the
headings and all scripts are at the end. No inline CSS and JS in between. Also, most of the elements, styling are using 
the class tag to achieve, such as col-md-4 means that occupies 4 columns on medium or above screen, some further functions
and styling are put in the css and js file. Therefore, no styling are using HTML tags. I used album from bootstrap to display
the product list in main page, which has thumbnail, name, price, and addToCart button, and it will redirect to product page
when clicked. The CSS hover of the shopping list is at the top navigation bar, which is the shopping cart image, when mouse hover it, it will pop a modal
to show the shopping list, with input boxes to input quantities and a check out button. Because the shopping cart is on the 
top navigation bar, it should show to all pages, which includes main and product pages. In the product page product1.html,
there are full image with item name, description, price, and addToCart button. Under the navigation bar, there is a hierarchical
navigation menu, which belongs to an element called Breadcrumb in bootstrap, it will show the current position or directory,
when clicking the words on it, it will go to that page. The slideshow is called as carousel in Bootstrap.
